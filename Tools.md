```
$ echo -e "row1\nrow2\nrow3\nrow4"> ~/"test 3"/4
$ echo -e "row1\nrow2\nrow3\nrow4"> ~/"test 3"/5
$ echo -e "row1\nrow2\nrow3\nrow4"> ~/"test 3"/6
```

```
$ cat *
row1
row2
row3
row4
row1
row2
row3
row4
row1
row2
row3
row4
```

Find the line row2 in file 5
```
$ grep row2 5

```
$ grep -r row .
./4:row1
./4:row2
./4:row3
./4:row4
./5:row1
./5:row2
./5:row3
./5:row4
./6:row1
./6:row2
